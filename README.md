💼 Executive Summary
In the insurance industry, data is the primary asset for managing risk. 

This project performs a 360-degree analysis of a Farmers Insurance dataset to uncover critical insights into customer behavior, policy distribution, and financial exposure.

By mapping the relationships between customers, their assets, and their claims, this project moves beyond simple data retrieval to provide actionable intelligence for risk assessment and customer segmentation.

🏗️ Data Ecosystem
The analysis is built upon a relational model that simulates a real-world insurance database. It connects five critical dimensions of the business:

    👥 Customer Base: Demographic and geographic distribution of policyholders.
    📜 Policy Architecture: Coverage details, premium structures, and deductibles.
    💸 Financial Claims: Tracking the lifecycle of a claim from incident to payout.
    🚗 Asset Portfolio: Analysis of insured vehicles (Make, Model, Year).

🛠️ SQL Arsenal project demonstrates advanced proficiency in SQL data manipulation:
    
    🔗 Complex Joins: Using INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN to combine data across the Customer, Policy, and Claim tables.
    📊 Aggregations: Using SUM(), AVG(), and COUNT() to summarize financial data.
    🔍 Pattern Matching: Using LIKE operators to filter specific car models or regions
    📉 Risk Segmentation: Implementing GROUP BY and ORDER BY to rank data
        

🚦 Driver Profiles: Risk assessment based on driver demographics (Age, Gender, Marital Status).

🔍 Strategic Analysis Modules
This project addresses four key business pillars through data analysis:

    1. Market Penetration & Demographics
    Goal: Understand where the customer base is concentrated.
    Analysis: We mapped customer density across different states to identify core markets and potential growth regions.

    2. Financial Risk & Exposure
    Goal: Quantify the financial burden on the company.
    Analysis: We aggregated total claim amounts by state and policy type. This highlights high-exposure regions where premium adjustments might be necessary.

    3. Asset & Policy Trends
    Goal: Analyze the portfolio of insured assets.
    Analysis: We calculated metrics such as the "Average Vehicles per Customer" and identified which car models are most frequently associated with claims.

    4. Risk Profiling
    Goal: Identify high-risk segments.
    Analysis: By correlating driver demographics (such as age and marital status) with claim frequency, we identified specific groups that drive higher loss ratios.

🛠️ Skills Demonstrated

    Relational Data Modeling: Understanding complex Many-to-One and One-to-Many relationships.
    Business Intelligence: Translating raw data into questions about profitability and risk.
    Data Aggregation: Summarizing granular transaction data into high-level executive insights.
    Pattern Recognition: Identifying correlations between asset types and financial loss.

🚀 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how structured data analysis can be used to optimize insurance operations. 

By identifying high-loss regions and high-risk driver profiles, the analysis provides the foundation for data-driven decisions in underwriting and premium pricing.
